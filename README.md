### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ¤“ About me 
Passionate about technology and innovation, I hold a degree in Dentistry from the Universidade Estadual do PiauÃ­, but I have been working as a software developer since I was 17. Currently, I am studying Software Engineering and focus on web development, aiming to create efficient solutions and integrations between systems.

I have experience with technologies such as PHP, Laravel, CodeIgniter, Node.js, relational and non-relational databases, Vue.js, among others. I am always eager to learn new tools and expand my technical repertoire according to project needs.

I work both on the back-end and front-end, contributing to the creation of corporate websites, maintenance, and development of new features in ERP systems and SaaS platforms for e-commerce stores.
Additionally, I have experience in related areas such as data and infrastructure, which broadens my systemic understanding of how applications function.

This journey has given me a comprehensive understanding of the development cycle, from conception to delivery of scalable solutions.
